## üìÖ **Week 6: Monitoring & Logging**

---

### üéØ **Goal:**

Understand the fundamentals of monitoring and logging systems in a DevOps environment. By the end of the week, you'll be able to:

* Collect and view application metrics using **Prometheus**
* Visualize metrics using **Grafana dashboards**
* Analyze AWS infrastructure logs and metrics using **CloudWatch**
* Understand basics of log aggregation with **ELK/EFK stack**

---

## üîç Topics to Learn (with Breakdown)

---

### 1. ‚úÖ **Monitoring: Concepts and Tools**

#### üß† What to Learn:

* What is monitoring?
* Difference between monitoring, logging, and observability
* Types of monitoring:

  * **Infrastructure Monitoring** (CPU, RAM, Disk)
  * **Application Monitoring** (HTTP latency, request counts, errors)
* Push vs Pull models
* Alerting basics (when and how to alert)

#### üîß Tools:

* Prometheus (metrics collection)
* Grafana (visualization)
* AWS CloudWatch (cloud resource metrics)
* Node Exporter / cAdvisor (exporters for Prometheus)

---

### 2. üì¶ **Prometheus Fundamentals**

#### üß† What to Learn:

* Prometheus architecture: time-series database, pull model, exporters
* Prometheus configuration (`prometheus.yml`)
* How metrics are scraped
* PromQL (Prometheus Query Language) basics
* Common Prometheus metrics format:
  `http_requests_total{method="GET", handler="/login"} 12`

#### üìò Practice:

* Set up Prometheus locally or in Docker
* Add `node_exporter` to expose system metrics
* Scrape a sample app exposing metrics on `/metrics` endpoint

---

### 3. üìä **Grafana Fundamentals**

#### üß† What to Learn:

* What is Grafana? Why use it?
* How to connect Grafana to Prometheus
* Creating dashboards and panels
* Setting up alerts and thresholds
* Using variables and filters

#### üìò Practice:

* Install Grafana (local or Docker)
* Create a dashboard with:

  * CPU usage
  * Memory consumption
  * HTTP request rate from app metrics

---

### 4. ‚òÅÔ∏è **AWS CloudWatch (Cloud-native Monitoring)**

#### üß† What to Learn:

* What is CloudWatch?
* CloudWatch Metrics vs Logs vs Events
* How to view logs/metrics for:

  * EC2 instances
  * Lambda functions
  * S3 buckets
* Creating dashboards and metric filters
* Creating alarms (e.g., CPU > 80%)

#### üìò Practice:

* Launch a basic EC2 instance
* Check CloudWatch metrics:

  * CPU Utilization
  * Disk I/O
* View system logs in CloudWatch Logs
* Set an alarm and test notification

---

### 5. üìÅ **Logging with ELK/EFK Stack (Optional ‚Äì Advanced)**

#### üß† What to Learn:

* What is centralized logging?
* ELK = Elasticsearch + Logstash + Kibana
* EFK = Elasticsearch + Fluentd + Kibana
* Log forwarding and parsing
* Viewing structured logs in Kibana

#### ‚öôÔ∏è Tools:

* Filebeat / Fluentd: log shippers
* Elasticsearch: log storage and search
* Kibana: visualization

#### üìò Practice:

* Run EFK stack using Docker Compose
* Forward logs from a sample app to Elasticsearch
* Visualize logs in Kibana (e.g., search for errors)
