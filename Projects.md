* **Cloud**: AWS
* **Monitoring**: Prometheus, Grafana, ELK stack

#### **Steps:**

1. **Build Microservices (Docker + Kubernetes)**

   * Develop a microservices-based application (e.g., user service, product service, and payment service).
   * Containerize each microservice using **Docker**.
   * Deploy these services in **Kubernetes** using **Helm** charts for consistency and easy deployment.

2. **Provision Cloud Resources (Terraform + AWS)**

   * Provision AWS resources (e.g., EC2, S3, IAM roles) with **Terraform** for the infrastructure needed to run the application.
   * Configure **Terraform state** management and ensure resources are securely provisioned.

3. **CI/CD Pipeline (Jenkins/GitHub Actions)**

   * Set up Jenkins or GitHub Actions to automate:

     * Code build and test
     * Container image creation
     * Deployment to Kubernetes
   * Use **GitHub Secrets** for managing credentials (e.g., AWS access keys, Docker registry passwords).

4. **GitOps (ArgoCD)**

   * Use **ArgoCD** to synchronize Kubernetes deployments directly from a Git repository, enabling continuous deployment.
   * Configure **auto-sync** in ArgoCD for new commits to the repository.

5. **Service Mesh (Istio/Linkerd)**

   * Implement a **service mesh** to manage inter-service communication, ensuring secure and observable microservices.
   * Configure **traffic splitting** and **canary releases** for safe, gradual rollouts.
